### Case Title

AI-powered Booking System for Kite Schools

### Background

Kite schools often face challenges in managing bookings, aligning instructor schedules with weather conditions, and providing a smooth customer experience. Existing solutions are fragmented and lack integration with weather forecasts, instructor profiles, and school operations. Inspired by platforms like Airbnb and Treatwell, there is a need for a modern booking system tailored to kite schools.

### Purpose

Create a booking and management platform for kite schools where students can book courses, instructors, and gear, while instructors and managers can efficiently handle scheduling, resources, and communication. AI will optimize schedules based on instructor knowledge, student levels, and weather conditions.

### Target Users

- Students/customers booking lessons or gear
- Instructors (beginners to advanced)
- School staff (owner, manager, receptionist, beach boy)
- Administrators overseeing operations

### Core Functionality

**Must Have (MVP)**

- User registration, login, and role-based access (owner, manager, instructor, receptionist, beach boy, customer)
- Course booking with calendar integration
- Instructor self-managed availability
- AI scheduling optimization (by skill level, weather, and instructor experience)
- Personalized recommendations by age, skill level, and preferences

**Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)**

- Payment integration for lessons and rentals
- Notifications and reminders for students and instructors
- Instructor introductions with profile links
- Instructor coupon codes to incentivize bookings
- Daily automatic messaging of timetables (advance & confirmed same-day with wind)
- Automatic rebooking and messaging for no-wind conditions
- Gear rental linked to inventory system
- Lesson packages at discounted rates
- Waitlist functionality for fully booked classes
- FAQ chatbot trained on school messages/emails
- Automatic messaging to review site
- Instructor filters (beginner-friendly, advanced, lesson type)
- Competitor analysis to identify kiteschool site improvements
- Google Calendar sync

### Data Requirements

- Users: role, name, contact, login credentials
- Instructors: certifications, experience, availability, IKO profile, coupon code
- Students: name, age, skill level, booking history
- Lessons: type, capacity, duration, package options
- Rentals: gear type, availability, inventory link
- Weather/tide data (via external APIs)
- Notifications/logs: booking confirmation, rebooking, daily timetables

### User Stories

1. As a customer, I want to receive recommendations for instructors based on my age and skill level, so I get the best possible learning experience.
2. As a student, I want to book a kite lesson and receive automatic updates if wind conditions change, so I can plan my day.
3. As an instructor, I want to sync my calendar with the platform, so I can avoid scheduling conflicts. I want to share my IKO profile and a custom introduction, so students can trust my qualifications.
4. As a school manager, I want to see a resource allocation plan, so I can ensure every student is matched with the right instructor.
5. As a receptionist, I want to easily rebook lessons in case of no-wind, so customer experience stays smooth.

### Technical Constraints

- Must support GDPR-compliant data handling
- Must use encryption for user and payment data
- Must integrate with weather APIs for real-time forecasts
- Must be responsive (mobile and desktop)
- Must support role-based access control
- AI complexity can vary: from basic scheduling to full dynamic optimization

### Success Criteria

- Students can book, rebook, and receive updates automatically
