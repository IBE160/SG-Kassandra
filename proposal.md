## Case Title

KiteOps: Intelligent rule-based Booking System for Kite Schools

## Executive Summary

KiteOps is an intelligent, rule-based booking and management platform designed for kite schools. It streamlines the coordination of students, instructors, and managers by integrating real-time weather data, Instructor expertise, and automated scheduling logic. The system optimizes lesson allocation, minimizes manual coordination, and enhances the overall booking experience for customers and staff alike.

By leveraging AI-assisted recommendations and weather-aware scheduling, KiteOps reduces operational overhead and enables kite schools to offer more efficient, reliable, and personalized services.

## Background

Kite schools often face challenges in managing bookings, aligning Instructor schedules with weather conditions, and providing a smooth Customer experience. Existing tools are fragmented, requiring manual coordination between booking, communication, and weather monitoring. KiteOps aims to deliver an integrated, intelligent booking and management platform specifically tailored to the needs of kite schools.

## Purpose

Create a booking and management platform for kite schools where students can book courses and gear, while instructors and managers can efficiently handle scheduling, resources, and communication. The intelligent rule-based booking system optimizes schedules based on Instructor knowledge, student levels, and weather conditions.

## Target Users

- Students/customers booking lessons
- Instructors managing availability and lesson details
- School staff (Manager role initially) coordinating schedules, resources, and operations
- Administrators overseeing operations

## User Stories

1. As a Customer, I want to find instructors suited to my age and skill level and receive automatic updates if weather conditions change, so I can plan my day effectively.
2. As an Instructor, I want to manage my availability and access student details so I can prepare appropriate lessons. I also want to share my professional profile to build trust with clients.
3. As a school Manager, I want a clear overview of resources, schedules, and communications so I can minimize manual coordination and improve operational efficiency.

## Technical Constraints

### Scheduling Engine Logic

The rule-based scheduling engine operates on a weighted decision model considering three primary factors:

- **Skill Match (50%)** – Aligns student skill levels with Instructor expertise and certifications.
- **Weather Suitability (30%)** – Analyzes forecast data to select optimal lesson windows.
- **Instructor Load Balancing (20%)** – Distributes sessions evenly among available instructors.

If weather API data is unavailable, KiteOps uses cached forecasts or allows manual Manager override to maintain continuity.

- Must support GDPR-compliant data handling
- Must use encryption for all user and payment data
- Must integrate with weather APIs for real-time forecasts
- Must be responsive for desktop
- Must support role-based access control
