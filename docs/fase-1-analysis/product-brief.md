# Product Brief: KiteOps

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Author:** Mary, Business Analyst

## 1. Executive Summary

KiteOps is an intelligent, rule-based booking and management platform for kite schools. It streamlines the coordination of students, instructors, and managers by integrating real-time weather data, instructor expertise, and automated scheduling logic. The system optimizes lesson allocation, minimizes manual coordination, and enhances the overall booking experience for customers and staff.

## 2. Problem Statement

Kite schools operate in a dynamic environment where weather conditions are unpredictable. The current process of managing bookings, scheduling instructors, and communicating with students is often manual, fragmented, and inefficient. This leads to operational overhead, scheduling conflicts, and a suboptimal experience for both customers and staff. Existing tools lack the intelligence and integration needed to address the specific challenges of the kitesurfing industry.

## 3. Proposed Solution

KiteOps will be a centralized platform that provides:

- **For Customers:** A simple and intuitive way to book lessons, receive real-time updates on weather conditions, and manage their schedule.
- **For Instructors:** A tool to manage their availability, view student details, and access their schedules.
- **For Managers:** A comprehensive overview of all school operations, including resource allocation, scheduling, and communication, with intelligent, rule-based automation to handle the complexities of weather-dependent scheduling.

## 4. Target Audience

- **Primary:**
  - **School Managers:** Responsible for the day-to-day operations of the kite school. They will benefit from reduced administrative work and improved efficiency.
  - **Instructors:** Who need a simple way to manage their schedules and communicate with students.
  - **Customers (Students):** Who want a seamless and reliable booking experience.
- **Secondary:**
  - **Administrators/Owners:** Who oversee the business and need high-level insights into the school's performance.

## 5. Goals and Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

- Reduce the time spent on manual scheduling and coordination by at least 50%.
- Increase instructor utilization and reduce downtime due to weather.
- Improve customer satisfaction and retention.
- Increase revenue by 15% in the first year by optimizing bookings and reducing cancellations.

### User Success Metrics

- **Customers:** Can successfully book a lesson in under 3 minutes.
- **Instructors:** Can manage their availability and view their schedule with no more than 2 clicks.
- **Managers:** Can get a clear overview of the day's schedule and resource allocation in a single dashboard view.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- ≥ 90% booking completion within three steps.
- ≥ 4.5/5 average user satisfaction from post-launch surveys.
- < 5% of bookings affected by weather conflicts after automation.

## 6. MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must-Haves)

## 10. Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- Must support GDPR-compliant data handling.
- Must use encryption for all user and payment data.
- Must integrate with weather APIs for real-time forecasts.

### Key Assumptions

- Kite schools are willing to adopt a new software solution to manage their operations.
- Weather API data is reliable and accurate enough for scheduling purposes.
- Users (especially instructors and managers) have a basic level of tech literacy.

## 11. Risks and Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Weather API Dependency:** The system's reliance on third-party weather APIs is a potential point of failure. A mitigation strategy is to use cached forecasts or allow manual overrides.
- **Instructor Adoption:** Instructors may be resistant to adopting a new system. A simple and intuitive UI is crucial for adoption.

### Open Questions

- What is the pricing model for KiteOps (e.g., subscription, per-booking fee)?
- What are the specific rules and weights for the intelligent scheduling engine?
- How will the system handle multi-day courses or camps?

## 12. Research Areas

- Further research into the most reliable and cost-effective weather APIs.
- User research to validate the proposed user flows and UI mockups.
- Analysis of competitor pricing models.
