## Sprint Change Proposal: Undefined Core User Stories

---

### Section 1: Issue Summary

**Problem Statement:** The project's implementation phase is currently blocked because the foundational Epics 1 (Core Platform Foundation & User Management) and Epic 2 (Intelligent Booking & Scheduling Engine) lack detailed user stories. This absence prevents development teams from commencing work on core functionalities, leading to a critical impediment to project progress.

**Context of Discovery:** This issue was identified during the `solutioning-gate-check` workflow, which assessed the project's readiness for Phase 4 (Implementation). The assessment concluded that the project was "NOT READY" specifically due to this critical gap in the development backlog.

**Evidence:** The `implementation-readiness-report-2025-10-25.md` explicitly highlights the undefined stories for Epics 1 and 2 as a critical issue.

### Section 2: Impact Analysis

**Epic Impact:**
*   **Epic 1 (Core Platform Foundation & User Management):** Cannot be initiated. All stories for user registration, authentication, and role-based access are undefined.
*   **Epic 2 (Intelligent Booking & Scheduling Engine):** Cannot be initiated. All stories for the core booking system and intelligent scheduling are undefined.
*   **Epic 3 (Real-time Communication & Manager Overview):** Implementation will be significantly delayed as it is dependent on the foundational work from Epics 1 and 2.

**Story Impact:** The absence of detailed stories for Epics 1 and 2 means that no development work can commence on the core features of the application. The initial project setup task, while critical, is not formally tracked as a story.

**Artifact Conflicts:**
*   **PRD:** No direct conflict, but the PRD's objectives cannot be met without the stories.
*   **Architecture:** No direct conflict, but the architectural decisions cannot be implemented without the stories. The implicit initial setup task needs formalization.
*   **UI/UX Specifications:** No direct conflict, but the UI/UX designs cannot be built without the stories.

**Technical Impact:** Development is at a standstill for core features. This leads to delays in the overall project timeline and potential resource underutilization if not addressed promptly.

### Section 3: Recommended Approach

**Selected Approach:** Direct Adjustment.

**Rationale:** This approach directly addresses the root cause of the implementation blockage. By prioritizing the creation of detailed user stories for Epics 1 and 2, the project can establish a clear, actionable backlog that is fully aligned with the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the defined architecture. While this will introduce a necessary delay in the commencement of coding, it is crucial to prevent larger risks, rework, and inefficiencies that would arise from attempting to implement without a clear understanding of the requirements. This ensures a more structured and successful path to delivering the project's core value.

**Effort Estimate:** High (significant effort required from Product Management/Analyst and Architect to define all stories).
**Risk Level:** Low (risk of further delays if story breakdown is not thorough).
**Timeline Impact:** Initial coding will be delayed until stories for Epics 1 and 2 are defined.

### Section 4: Detailed Change Proposals

**Proposal 1: Update Epics Document for Story Breakdown Requirement**

*   **Artifact:** `epics.md`
*   **Section:** Epic List - High-Level Delivery Sequence
*   **Description:** Explicitly state that Epic 1 and Epic 2 require a detailed story breakdown before implementation can begin.

```markdown
OLD:
*   **Epic 1: Core Platform Foundation & User Management**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure, secure user authentication, and role-based access for all user types (Customer, Instructor, Manager).
    *   **Estimated Story Count:** 7 stories
*   **Epic 2: Intelligent Booking & Scheduling Engine (MVP)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement the core calendar-based booking system, enable instructors to manage their availability, and integrate the initial rule-based intelligent scheduling engine.
    *   **Estimated Story Count:** 9 stories

NEW:
*   **Epic 1: Core Platform Foundation & User Management**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure, secure user authentication, and role-based access for all user types (Customer, Instructor, Manager).
    *   **Status:** **Requires Story Breakdown.** Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria must be defined before implementation.
    *   **Estimated Story Count:** 7 stories (to be detailed)
*   **Epic 2: Intelligent Booking & Scheduling Engine (MVP)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement the core calendar-based booking system, enable instructors to manage their availability, and integrate the initial rule-based intelligent scheduling engine.
    *   **Status:** **Requires Story Breakdown.** Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria must be defined before implementation.
    *   **Estimated Story Count:** 9 stories (to be detailed)
```

**Proposal 2: Formalize Initial Project Setup as a Story**

*   **Artifact:** `epics.md`
*   **Section:** Epic 1: Core Platform Foundation & User Management (New Story)
*   **Description:** Add the essential project initialization step as a formal user story within Epic 1 to ensure it is tracked and managed.

```markdown
OLD:
*   **Epic 1: Core Platform Foundation & User Management**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure, secure user authentication, and role-based access for all user types (Customer, Instructor, Manager).
    *   **Status:** **Requires Story Breakdown.** Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria must be defined before implementation.
    *   **Estimated Story Count:** 7 stories (to be detailed)

NEW:
*   **Epic 1: Core Platform Foundation & User Management**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure, secure user authentication, and role-based access for all user types (Customer, Instructor, Manager).
    *   **Status:** **Requires Story Breakdown.** Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria must be defined before implementation.
    *   **Estimated Story Count:** 7 stories (to be detailed)

    ### Story Breakdown (Initial)

    **Story 1.0: Project Repository & CI/CD Setup**
    *   **Goal:** Initialize the project repository and set up continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines to ensure a robust development environment.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A new Next.js project is initialized using `npx create-next-app@latest kiteops --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"`.
        2.  The project is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
        3.  Basic CI/CD pipelines are configured for automated testing and deployment to a staging environment.
        4.  All necessary development dependencies are installed and configured.
```

### Section 5: Implementation Handoff

**Change Scope Classification:** Moderate. This change requires significant backlog reorganization and coordination between Product Owners/Scrum Masters and the Architect.

**Handoff Recipients and Responsibilities:**
*   **Product Manager/Analyst:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Lead the `create-story` workflow to break down Epic 1 and Epic 2 into detailed user stories with clear acceptance criteria. Ensure alignment with the PRD and UX specifications.
*   **Architect (Winston - me):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Provide architectural guidance during the story breakdown process to ensure technical feasibility and alignment with the defined architecture. Formalize the initial project setup task as a story within Epic 1.
*   **Development Team:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Await the completion of the story breakdown for Epics 1 and 2. Once stories are defined and prioritized, begin implementation.

**Success Criteria for Implementation:**
*   Detailed user stories for Epic 1 and Epic 2 are created and approved.
*   The initial project setup task is formally added to the backlog as a story.
*   A subsequent `solutioning-gate-check` workflow is performed and passes successfully, confirming readiness for Phase 4.
