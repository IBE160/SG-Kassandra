# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-24
**Facilitator:** Strategic Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** KiteOps Scheduling Logic
**Session Goals:** Explore and refine the intelligent rule-based scheduling engine, considering its weighted decision model and potential edge cases.
**Techniques Used:** Five Whys, Morphological Analysis, Assumption Reversal
**Total Ideas Generated:** 20+ distinct ideas and numerous sub-points

### Key Themes Identified:

*   Optimization of instructor resources based on skill.
*   Systematic breakdown of scheduling parameters.
*   Dynamic adaptation of scheduling logic based on external factors (e.g., booking horizon, weather reliability).
*   Transparency and explainability in scheduling decisions.

## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys:

*   **Problem:** Highly experienced instructors assigned to beginners, leading to advanced instructor shortage and lost revenue.
*   **Root Cause:** Scheduling logic doesn't prioritize advanced instructors for advanced lessons.

### Morphological Analysis:

*   **Skill Match:** Student Skill Levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), Lesson Types (Private, Group, Refresher, Advanced).
*   **Weather Suitability:** `min_wind_speed`, `max_wind_speed`, `preferred_directions`, `allow_precipitation`, `latitude`, `longitude`.
*   **Instructor Load Balancing:** Current Workload (hours booked), Expertise (advanced instructors less assigned to beginners).
*   **Time/Availability:** School Opening Hours, Instructor-Provided Availability.

### Assumption Reversal:

*   Confirmed "best match" is crucial for resource availability.
*   **Critical Insight:** Dynamic weighting for Weather Suitability: reduced/zero weight for bookings >1 week out; Skill Match and Load Balancing take precedence.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

*   Implement logic to prioritize advanced instructors for advanced lessons.
*   Integrate all identified parameters into the scheduling engine design.
*   Implement dynamic weighting for Weather Suitability based on booking horizon (e.g., zero weight for bookings >1 week out).

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

*   Detailed design of the "load number" calculation and its integration into the scheduling engine.
*   Refinement of dynamic weighting rules for various scenarios.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

*   Not explicitly categorized in this session.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

*   The importance of a systematic approach to defining all scheduling parameters.
*   The need for dynamic and adaptive scheduling logic that accounts for real-world constraints like weather forecast reliability.
*   The direct link between effective scheduling and business outcomes (revenue, instructor satisfaction).

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

*   Not explicitly prioritized in this session.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

*   The combination of analytical techniques (Five Whys, Morphological Analysis) and creative challenge (Assumption Reversal) provided a comprehensive exploration of the scheduling logic.
*   The user's detailed input on parameters and insights was highly valuable.

### Areas for Further Exploration

*   Quantifying the exact weights and thresholds for each parameter in different scenarios.
*   Designing the UI for managers to configure weather parameters and view scheduling decisions.
*   Considering how to handle overlapping time slots or partial availability.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

*   **Decision Tree Analysis:** To map out the scheduling logic flow.
*   **Scenario Planning:** To test the scheduling engine against various complex booking situations.

### Questions That Emerged

*   What are the precise thresholds for "advanced" instructor assignment?
*   How will the system handle conflicting priorities between skill match and load balancing?
*   What is the exact definition of "unreliable" for long-term weather forecasts in terms of impact on scheduling?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** Detailed design of scheduling algorithms, UI for scheduling configuration, or testing scenarios.
- **Recommended timeframe:** As needed, based on project progress.
- **Preparation needed:** Review of this brainstorming report.
