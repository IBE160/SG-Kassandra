# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-24
**Facilitator:** Strategic Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** KiteOps User Flows
**Session Goals:** Identify missing flows or steps
**Techniques Used:** Negative User Journeys, "What If" Scenarios, Role Playing
**Total Ideas Generated:** 20+ distinct ideas and numerous sub-points

### Key Themes Identified:

*   Transparency and clear communication with users (customers, instructors, managers).
*   Automation with intelligent overrides and exceptions.
*   Proactive problem-solving and guidance within the system.
*   Resilience and real-time response to unexpected events (e.g., weather).
*   Workload balancing and fairness for instructors.

## Technique Sessions

### Negative User Journeys:

*   **Customer "No Results":** Need clear reasons (weather/availability), proactive suggestions (next available, alternative lesson types), and waitlist options.
*   **Instructor Manual Availability:** Need automated recurring availability with manual override and Google Calendar sync.
*   **Manager Incorrect Weather Data:** Need configurable wind conditions, manual booking override, and intelligent alerts with options (override, rebook, cancel).
*   **Manager Uneven Instructor Load:** Need tools to see workload distribution and a "load number" for balancing.

### "What If" Scenarios:

*   **Customer Skill Level Change:** Customer self-updates profile, instructor/manager handles rebooking, system provides skill assessment guidance, instructors can search/reassign.
*   **Sudden Weather Change:** Both instructor/manager can cancel/alter, instant notifications to all, automated rebooking/refund options.

### Role Playing:

*   **New Customer:** Needs clear lesson info, transparent pricing, weather disclaimer, skill assessment guidance, instructor info, and price confirmation on booking screen.
*   **New Instructor:** Needs immediate access to calendar, upcoming lessons, student info, current/next day schedule, and detailed customer/lesson info on click.
*   **New Manager:** Needs calendar overview, upcoming courses, quick access to today/tomorrow, and transparency into booking matching criteria/weights to understand load balancing.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

*   Clear lesson descriptions and pricing on customer-facing pages.
*   Explicit weather disclaimer on booking pages.
*   Guidance for skill level assessment for customers.
*   Transparent instructor information on the booking screen.
*   Proactive suggestions for "no results" scenarios (different dates, lesson types).
*   Automated recurring availability for instructors.
*   Configurable min/max wind conditions for managers.
*   Manual booking override for managers.
*   Intelligent alerts for weather with clear options for managers.
*   Instructor calendar visibility and assigned hours for managers.
*   Ability for both instructors and managers to cancel/alter lessons in real-time.
*   Instant notifications for weather disruptions.
*   Automated rebooking/refund options for weather cancellations.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

*   Google Calendar synchronization for instructors.
*   Waitlist options for customers.
*   "Load number" system for balancing instructor hours.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

*   Not explicitly categorized in this session.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

*   The importance of managing user expectations, especially regarding weather and availability.
*   The need for robust communication channels for real-time updates and critical events.
*   The value of automation balanced with manual override capabilities for flexibility.
*   The necessity of transparency and explainability in intelligent system decisions (e.g., scheduling).
*   The critical role of a well-designed dashboard that prioritizes relevant information for each user role.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

*   Not explicitly prioritized in this session.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

*   The structured approach of using "Negative User Journeys," "What If" Scenarios, and "Role Playing" effectively uncovered a wide range of potential issues and valuable enhancements across all user flows.
*   The user's active participation and detailed responses provided rich insights.

### Areas for Further Exploration

*   Detailed design of the "load number" calculation and its integration into the scheduling engine.
*   Specific UI/UX considerations for implementing the suggested proactive suggestions and alerts.
*   Technical feasibility and implementation details for Google Calendar synchronization.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

*   **User Story Mapping:** To integrate these insights into concrete user stories.
*   **Impact/Effort Matrix:** To prioritize the identified features.

### Questions That Emerged

*   How will the "load number" be calculated and displayed?
*   What are the specific UI elements for skill level assessment guidance?
*   What are the technical requirements for instant notifications and real-time communication?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** Prioritization of features, detailed user story creation, or technical deep dive into specific features.
- **Recommended timeframe:** As needed, based on project progress.
- **Preparation needed:** Review of this brainstorming report.
