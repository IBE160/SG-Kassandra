## Story

As a Customer,
I want to be able to search for available kite lessons and filter them by criteria such as date, lesson type, and skill level,
so that I can easily find a suitable lesson.

2. Customers can specify a desired date or date range for lessons.
3. Customers can filter lessons by type (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
4. Customers can filter lessons by required skill level.
5. The search results display available lesson slots, considering instructor availability and skill match.
