# Story 3.5: Manager Initiated Schedule Adjustments

Status: Draft

## Story

As a manager,
I want to be able to manually adjust or reassign lessons from the dashboard,
so that I can respond to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., instructor illness, sudden weather changes).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Manager can select a booked lesson and reassign it to another available instructor.
2. Manager can cancel a lesson.
3. System prompts for notification to affected parties upon adjustment.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Implement functionality on the manager dashboard to adjust and reassign lessons.
  - [ ] Trigger notifications to affected users.

## Dev Notes

- This requires careful handling of state changes and notifications.
