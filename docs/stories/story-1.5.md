# Story 1.5: User Password Management

Status: Completed

## Story

As a registered user,
I want to be able to securely change my password after logging in,
so that I can maintain the security of my account.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can access a "Change Password" option within their profile or account settings.
2. The system requires the user to enter their current password before setting a new one.
3. The new password must meet the defined strong password policies.
4. The system provides appropriate feedback for successful password changes or errors (e.g., incorrect current password).
5. Upon successful password change, the user is notified (e.g., via email).
6. The system securely stores the new password (e.g., hashed).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
