# Story 2.1: Instructor Availability Management

Status: Draft

## Story

As an Instructor,
I want to be able to easily set and manage my availability for lessons on a calendar,
so that the system accurately reflects when I am free to teach and prevents double-bookings.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Instructors can access a dedicated "My Availability" section within their dashboard.
2. The interface displays a calendar view (e.g., weekly or monthly).
3. Instructors can select specific time slots on the calendar to mark themselves as available or unavailable.
4. Instructors can set recurring availability patterns (e.g., "available every Monday and Wednesday from 9 AM to 5 PM").
5. Instructors can block out specific dates or times for personal appointments or holidays.
6. Changes to availability are immediately reflected in the system and prevent new bookings during unavailable times.
7. The system provides visual confirmation of saved availability changes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create an availability management page with a calendar component.
