# Story 1.0: Project Repository & CI/CD Setup

Status: Draft

## Story

As a Developer,
I want to initialize the project repository and set up CI/CD,
so that I can have a robust development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new Next.js project is initialized using `npx create-next-app@latest kiteops --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"`.
2. The project is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
3. Basic CI/CD pipelines are configured for automated testing and deployment to a staging environment.
4. All necessary development dependencies are installed and configured.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js project using the specified command.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Initialize Git repository.
  - [ ] Add all project files to the repository.
  - [ ] Make the initial commit.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create a basic CI/CD pipeline configuration file (e.g., for GitHub Actions).
  - [ ] The pipeline should run on push to the main branch.
  - [ ] The pipeline should install dependencies and run the linter.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Identify and install any additional development dependencies.

## Dev Notes

- The project initialization command is specified in the architecture document.
- `npx create-next-app@latest kiteops --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"`

### Project Structure Notes

- The project will be initialized with a `src` directory.
- Alias `@/*` will be configured for imports.
