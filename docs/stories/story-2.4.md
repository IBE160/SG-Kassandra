# Story 2.4: Rule-Based Intelligent Slot Suggestion

Status: Draft

## Story

As a system,
I want to suggest optimal lesson slots to customers based on predefined rules (e.g., instructor skill, student skill, weather conditions, instructor load balancing),
so that bookings are efficient, safe, and maximize resource utilization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system integrates with an external weather API to retrieve real-time weather forecasts for lesson locations (NFR003), including parameters such as `min_wind_speed`, `max_wind_speed`, `preferred_directions`, `allow_precipitation`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.
2. When a customer searches for lessons, the system filters available slots based on:
    *   Instructor availability (from Story 2.1).
    *   Instructor's skill level matching the lesson type/student's skill level.
    *   Weather conditions (e.g., wind speed within acceptable range for the lesson type), applying **dynamic weighting for weather suitability based on the booking horizon (e.g., reduced or zero weight for bookings more than 1 week out, with skill match and load balancing taking precedence for longer-term bookings).**
3. The system prioritizes suggestions to balance instructor workload, considering factors such as **current hours booked and expertise**.
4. The suggested slots are presented clearly to the customer.
5. The rules for slot suggestion are configurable by a manager (e.g., acceptable wind ranges, instructor-to-student ratios).
6. The system provides a mechanism to handle scenarios where no optimal slots are found (e.g., suggest alternative dates or notify when slots become available).
