# Story 1.4: Supabase Database & Auth Setup

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up the Supabase database schema and integrate Supabase Authentication,
so that the backend infrastructure supports user registration, login, role management, and secure data storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Supabase project is initialized and configured for the KiteOps application.
2. The necessary database tables (e.g., `profiles`, `roles`) are created with appropriate columns and relationships to support user profiles and role-based access.
3. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are implemented for all sensitive tables to ensure data privacy and access control based on user roles.
4. Supabase Authentication is integrated, allowing for email/password sign-up and sign-in.
5. The application can successfully connect to the Supabase database and authentication services.
6. Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user profiles are functional via Supabase.
7. Environment variables for Supabase connection are securely configured.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Create a new Supabase project.
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for Supabase.
