# KiteOps Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) plan for the KiteOps intelligent rule-based booking system. The primary goal of this PoC is to validate the core technical architecture, key functionalities, and the feasibility of the proposed technology stack (Next.js, FastAPI, Supabase) in addressing the project's critical requirements, particularly the intelligent scheduling engine and real-time updates.

## 2. PoC Scope & Objectives

The PoC will focus on the riskiest and most innovative aspects of the MVP.

### Objectives:
*   Validate the integration and interoperability of Next.js, FastAPI, and Supabase.
*   Demonstrate secure user authentication and role-based access control (Customer, Instructor, Manager).
*   Prove the concept of a calendar-based booking system with basic availability management.
*   Showcase the intelligent scheduling engine's ability to factor in weather data and instructor availability.
*   Verify real-time updates for booking status and notifications using Supabase Realtime.

### Out of Scope for PoC:
*   Full UI/UX design and polish.
*   Payment integration (Stripe).
*   Comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   Advanced reporting and analytics.
*   All "Nice to Have" features from the proposal.

## 3. Key Features to Implement in PoC

1.  **User Authentication & Profile (Customer & Instructor):**
    *   Secure registration and login using Supabase Auth.
    *   Basic profile creation for Customer (skill level) and Instructor (availability preferences).
    *   Role assignment (Customer/Instructor) upon registration.

2.  **Instructor Availability Management:**
    *   Instructor dashboard to view and set basic availability slots (e.g., 2-hour blocks).
    *   Supabase database to store instructor availability.

3.  **Basic Booking Flow (Customer):**
    *   Customer logs in and views available instructors/slots.
    *   Ability to select an instructor and a time slot.
    *   Booking confirmation (simple database entry).

4.  **Intelligent Scheduling Engine (Core Logic - FastAPI):**
    *   A simplified FastAPI endpoint that, given a desired lesson time, fetches:
        *   Instructor availability from Supabase.
        *   Mock weather data (or a simplified OpenWeatherMap call).
    *   The engine will suggest available slots, prioritizing based on instructor availability and "good" weather conditions (e.g., wind speed within a certain range).
    *   This will *not* include the full weighted decision model, but a basic demonstration of its principles.

5.  **Real-time Booking Updates:**
    *   When a booking is made, the Instructor's dashboard should update in real-time to reflect the new booking.
    *   A simple notification (e.g., a toast message) on the Customer's dashboard upon booking confirmation.

## 4. Technology Stack for PoC

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
*   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
*   **Database/Auth/Realtime**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Weather Data**: Mock data or a simplified OpenWeatherMap API call within FastAPI.

## 5. Success Criteria

The PoC will be considered successful if:
*   Users can successfully register, log in, and be assigned roles.
*   Instructors can set and view their availability.
*   Customers can view available slots and make a booking.
*   The FastAPI scheduling engine can process availability and (mock) weather data to suggest suitable slots.
*   Real-time updates are observed on the Instructor dashboard when a new booking is made.
*   The chosen technologies integrate seamlessly without major blockers.

## 6. High-Level Timeline (1-2 Weeks)

*   **Week 1:**
    *   **Day 1-2:** Project setup (Next.js, FastAPI, Supabase), basic Supabase Auth integration.
    *   **Day 3-4:** Implement Instructor availability management (frontend & Supabase).
    *   **Day 5:** Implement basic Customer booking flow (frontend & Supabase).
*   **Week 2:**
    *   **Day 1-2:** Develop simplified FastAPI scheduling engine, integrate with Supabase and mock weather.
    *   **Day 3-4:** Integrate FastAPI suggestions into the Next.js booking flow.
    *   **Day 5:** Implement Supabase Realtime for booking notifications/updates. Review and demonstrate.

## 7. Next Steps

Upon successful completion of the PoC, we will proceed with full-scale development, incorporating the remaining MVP features and refining the UI/UX.
